    Climate change is projected to alter marine ecosystem structure and function globally. Modelling these changes is challenging, partly because projections of the future physical environment are uncertain, especially in the highly productive, and variable, ocean upwelling areas such as the Southern Benguela Upwelling System (SBUS) off southern Africa. Here, we describe application of the StrathE2E functional guild-based end-to-end ecosystem model to the SBSU, forced by a four-member ensemble of NEMO-ERSEM physical-biogeochemistry model outputs. The ensemble covered two different Earth System Models (ESM) which provided driving data sets (2010 – 2070) for NEMO (GFDL-ESM4 and CNRM-CM6-1-HR), each under two different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) and Relative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emissions scenarios (1-2.6: Sustainability – Taking the Green Road, and 3-7.0: Regional Rivalry – A Rocky Road).
    High trophic level guilds in StrathE2E, such as cetaceans, demersal fish and seabirds, were consistently projected to increase in biomass under all the driving data ensemble members. However, net primary production, and other low trophic level guilds, exhibited diverging trajectories between the two ESM driving data members, implying major differences in the emergent trophic efficiency of the system. Environmental driver sensitivity analyses suggest high contribution of vertical mixing to variation in low trophic level guilds across the ESMs. These findings highlight the sensitivity of the SPSU ecosystem to ocean conditions, and especially the need for advancements in monitoring and modelling of upwelling changes for the region.

# Introduction

-   **Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems**

Temperate marine ecosystems globally are facing increasing environmental change in ocean
temperature, nutrient availability and stratification [@fox-kemper2021]. Species survival
and ecosystem functioning in marine ecosystems are vulnerable to increasingly variable
environmental conditions **citation**, influencing the provision of ecosystem services such
as fisheries **citation**. Upwelling-reliant marine ecosystems face particular uncertainty
and low-confidence around current predictions of future climate change impacts
[@fox-kemper2021]. This investigation aims to assess the drivers of possible future
ecosystem change in the Southern Benguela Upwelling System (SBUS), South Africa.

-   **Southern Benguela Upwelling System**

The SBUS is a large Eastern Boundary Upwelling System (EBUS) that extends around the western
cape of South Africa, from the warm Aghulas current in the south to the northern Benguela
system in the north. The SBUS is a highly productive wind-driven upwelling system,
supporting large-scale-commercial, small-scale and recreational fisheries for South Africa
[@hutchings2009; @sumaila2016]. Productivity in this ecosystem exhibits high seasonal and
decadal variability due to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and
upwelling [@lamont2014]. Recent interest in Integrated Ecosystem Assessment and
ecosystem-scale approaches to fisheries management in the Southern Benguela highlight the
importance of ecosystem-scale modelling approaches for management in the region
[@bornman2025]. End-to-end ecosystem modelling has suggested high sensitivity to plankton
growth rates [@ortega-cisneros2017], and high importance of forage fish and top-predators
for trophic control of the food web [@travers-trolet2014].

-   **Climate change impacts in SBUS**

Ecosystem modelling using Atlantis found that the ecosystem is likely to face predatory fish
declines due to temperature change, leading to increases in planktivorous fish
[@ortega-cisneros2018]. This investigation uses StrathE2E, a nutrient-driven end-to-end
ecosystem model, employing an exploratory scenario modelling approach to uncover possible
future climate change impacts and causal drivers of change. In EBUS, such as the Southern
Benguela, conditions under climate change are highly uncertain due to a limited
understanding of how and by what magnitude wind-driven upwelling processes may change
[@fox-kemper2021]. High uncertainty in nutrient upwelling leads to low confidence in
ecosystem response predictions [@fox-kemper2021]. Scenario uncertainty, uncertainty due to
modelling under uncertain future conditions, plays a large role in projecting ecosystem
models under climate change [@payne2016].

This investigation aims to identify causal relationships between environmental drivers,
including inorganic nutrients and upwelling, and ecosystem state for the Southern Benguela
Upwelling System using a scenario modelling approach across six decades and four possible
futures to account for high scenario uncertainty.

# Methods

## Study Area

This investigation models the Southern Benguela ecosystem, extending from the northern South
Africa EEZ border to the Agulhas Bank in the south. The Agulhas Current is a warm-water
Western Boundary current that flows southwards along the eastern coast of Southern Africa.
The Agulhas Current terminates at the Agulhas Bank, where the Southern Benguela current
begins, transporting upwelled cold water northwards along the western coast. This creates a
distinct divide in environmental conditions in the currents to the east and west of the
Agulhas Bank [@lutjeharms2006]. To define the continental shelf region included in this
investigation, we exclude any areas that are situated at more than 800m depth
(@sfig-distance-depth-map). Cumulative fishing effort data [@globalfishingwatch2025]
suggests that this domain definition captures a key fishing region, with different spatial
patterns of fishing occurring in deeper waters and in the waters of the Agulhas current
(@sfig-fishing-map).

We define the inshore region of the Southern Benguela modelling domain as continental shelf
with a distance to shore of 20km and depth of less than 50m. This inshore region is defined
to separate the influence of nearshore processes such as river inputs and shore-based /
nearshore fishing pressure from the offshore region. The offshore region encapsulates all
other areas in the model domain beyond this boundary.

The model domain is separated into 8 sediment-derived habitat types: rock, gravel, sand and
mud sediment types for the inshore and offshore zones (@fig-habitat-map). Sediment maps were
digitised and georeferenced from Birch et al. [-@birch1987]. These sediment types represent
different levels of nutrient reflectance back into the water column after settlement. The 8
habitat types are primarily used to parameterise the distribution of fishing fleet pressure
over the model domain area, rather than explicitly represent the spatial distribution of the
functional groups' biomass over the habitats.

inshore and offshore regions that are used to distributed fishing
effort.](../figs/habitat_map.png){#fig-habitat-map width="14.82cm"}

## Ecosystem model

### Box 1: StrathE2E Marine Ecosystem Model Description

StrathE2E combines a dynamic model of marine ecology and a static model of fishing activity,
coded as a package for the R computing environment (Heath et al. 2021). The ecology model is
a set of coupled ordinary differential equations representing the continuous-time rates of
change in nitrogen mass of 26 non-living and living guilds of material due to flows through
a food web network. The guilds span dissolved inorganic nutrient, detritus and microbes,
through classes of plankton, benthos and fish to birds and mammals. The flows represent
predation, food assimilation, metabolism, excretion, demographic transitions (for fish and
benthos guilds; spawning and recruitment), passive advection, active migrations, and fishery
harvest. The spatial resolution is coarse, in keeping with the guild granularity of the food
web - an “inshore” and “offshore” zone, linked by advection and migration. Each zone is
further subdivided into 4 seabed habitats and, in the offshore zone, 2 water column layers.
The seabed habitats are biogeochemical compartments with discrete rates of processing
detritus mineralisation and nutrient recycling constrained by sediment grain size, and the
sensitivity of these to disturbance e.g. by fishing abrasion. External environmental drivers
are monthly resolution annual cycles of time-varying physical and chemical data
(temperatures, marine hydrodynamics and river hydrology, sea surface light, turbidity, and
boundary data on inorganic nutrient concentrations and volumetric fluxes of water). The
model outputs state variable nitrogen masses of each guild in each compartment and the flows
between them, at daily intervals.

The StrathE2E fishing model integrates externally defined properties of up to 12 fishing
métiers - groups of vessels defined by the fishing gears they use - which selectively
harvest distinctive sets of guilds in the ecology model. Properties of each metier are their
habitat-level spatial distributions of activity rate, selectivity for ecology model guilds,
discarding, offal generation and seabed abrasion rates. The outputs from the fishing model
are integrated zone and guild-level fishing mortality, discarding and offal generation
rates, and habitat-level seabed abrasion rates. These are injected as parameters into the
ecology model and assumed to remain constant over all upcoming years of simulation.

### Parameterisation for Southern Benguela

To implement StrathE2E (**Box 1**) for the Southern Benguela, we collated region-specific
inputs from available data, literature and regional expert knowledge. This includes input
data representing fishing fleets operating in the region and their catch of the modelled
guilds, biological event timing data for key regional species for each guild and
observational target data for parameter optimisation of the ecosystem model. Additionally,
environmental driving data for the model implementation region was extracted from NemoERSEM
output **insert NEMO-ERSEM citation** (see environmental driving data section below).

### Environmental driving data

StrathE2E uses monthly driving data for physical and chemical variables annually averaged
from each decadal time period. Physical driving data include variables such as temperature,
light, river inflow volumes and boundary flow rates for each water volume. Chemical driving
data include nutrient concentrations for each of the volumes and from sources such as water
volume boundaries and river inputs. Environmental driving data were extracted from
Nemo-ERSEM biogeochemical model outputs forced by two Earth System Models (ESMs: CNRM and
GFDL \[**get the specific ESM identifiers\]**) under two Shared-Socioeconomic-Pathways
(SSPs: SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0). Environmental driving data were averaged across decades
including 2010-2019, 2020-2029, 2030-2039, 2040-2049, 2050-2059, 2060-2069. Additional
information on environmental driving data processing can be found in \[**insert
supplementary table ref\]**.

## Initial climate change analyses

To assess how future change may impact the Southern Benguela ecosystem we model the
ecosystem using driving data across the six decades, under the two ESMs and two SSPs. Under
these scenarios we explore steady state biomass values, averaged across the domain area, for
each modelled guild. To assess the broad climate change impacts across these decades and
scenarios, we visualise these outputs as time series across the decades.

To explore the drivers and trends of ecosystem state under climate change we perform
principal component analysis (PCA) on the steady state biomass values, rotating the
multivariate guild biomass values along two principal components (PC1 and PC2). To identify
guilds that contribute strongly to across decade and across ESM variation in the principal
components we calculate the average vector between the decades and average vector between
the ESMs in PC space. We then quantify the guild's contribution as the angle between guild
biomass PCA loadings and the variation vectors, selecting guilds that strongly correlate
with across decade and ESM variation.

Following initial climate change analyses, both CNRM-CM6-1-HR and GFDL-ESM4 StrathE2E models
for the Southern Benguela ecosystem experienced high levels of parameter uncertainty
(@fig-biomass-timeseries). High parameter uncertainty indicates low confidence in forcasted
model values. As a result, this investigation does not focus on specific predictions of
guild biomasses. Instead, this investigation focusses on identifying causal drivers of
change in the ecosystem using environmental driver experiments. This experimental rather
than predictive approach emphasises the utility of a computationally efficient end-to-end
ecosystem model in a data-poor context.

## Demersal fish sensitivity analysis

Initial results from the StrathE2E models identified high parameter uncertainty for closely
linked predatory guilds such as planktivorous fish, demersal fish, pinnipeds, birds and
cetaceans, likely due to high reliance of demersal fish on recruitment for biomass
maintainence **\[Need to include supplementary table showing dfish biomass rates.\]**. To
investigate the influence of demersal fish larvae parameterisation on predatory guilds a
One-at-a-Time local sensitivity analysis was performed. Demersal fish larvae density
dependent mortality; nitrogen uptake half-saturation coefficient; and maximum nitrogen
uptake rate parameter values were sampled in 100 evenly spaced steps from -25% to +25% of
the base parameter value from CNRM-CM6-1-HR and GFDL-ESM4 models respectively. A total of
600 model runs were performed (300 for each parameterised StrathE2E model).

## Climate permutation analyses

To quantify the influence of environmental input driving data on the state of the ecosystem
under different contexts we perform permutation analyses to calculate the contribution of
each variable group to the ecosystem outcomes. To perform these analyses we group variables
according to @tbl-variable-groups. Once a set of permuted models is created, we collate
annual biomass results for each target guild and calculate the variance-based Shapley Effect
value of each variable for each of the target guild biomass result sets.

| Variables | Variable group | Group description | Group varies across |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| sslight | Light | Surface light penetration. | Decade, ESM, SSP |
| so_temp, d_temp, si_temp | Temperature | Water volume temperatures. | Decade, ESM, SSP |
| rivervol, rivnitrate, rivammonia, rivdetritus | River outputs | River output volume and nutrient outflow concentrations into si habitat. | Decade, ESM, SSP |
| logkvert, d_so_upwelling, so_d_downwelling | Vertical mixing | Upwelling, downwelling and vertical diffusivity between surface and deep offshore water volumes. | Decade, ESM, SSP |

| so_atmnitrate, so_atmammonia, si_atmnitrate, si_atmammonia | Atmospheric nutrient flux | Deposition rates of nitrate and ammonia into surface water volumes. | Decade, SSP |

{#tbl-variable-groups}

### Shapley effects

Shapley Effects quantify the contribution of a variable to variance in a target model
output. Variance-based Shapley Effects are an extension of Shapley Values, which are a fair
way to calculate the contribution of each variable to a given output [@shapley1952]
(@eq-shapleyvalue).

$$
\phi_j(val) = \sum_{S \subseteq \{1,\ldots,p\}\setminus\{j\}} 
   \frac{|S|!(p-|S|-1)!}{p!}\,\big(val(S \cup \{j\}) - val(S)\big)
$$ {#eq-shapleyvalue}

Where $\phi_j$ is the Shapley value for variable $j$, $S$ is a subset of input variables not
including $j$. To extend this calculation to variance-based Shapley Effects [@song2016] on
discrete inputs (levels = model variants), we substitute $val(S)$ for @eq-varexplained,
calculating the output variance explained by inputs from a set of variables $S$. The
resulting Shapley Effect for variable $j$ represents the sum of marginal contributions of
variable $j$ to all coalitions of other input variables. By calculating the contribution of
$j$ to all possible coalitions of other variables, Shapley Effects incorporate the
interactions between variables, using a full factorial permutation set to calculate exact
Shapley Effects.

Var[E[Y|X_S]]
$$ {#eq-varexplained}

### Climate modelling scenario permutation analyses

To assess how our environmental drivers contribute to model outputs across the available
Earth System Models, we perform permutations of variables across these levels, within each
decade and SSP analysed. Within each decade, six variable groups (light, temperature, river
outputs, vertical mixing and volume nutrient concentrations) vary across ESMs, with two
possible sets of values per decade (CNRM-CM6-1-HR, GFDL-ESM4). To streamline communication
of guild Shapley Effect results, we select guilds that have a PCA loading angle to the
across ESM variation vector of less than 30° (in addition to assessment of Net Primary
Production).

To assess the influence of these variable groups across ESM derived model variation, within
each decade and SSP the full factorial cross of variable group sets are used as model
inputs. These unique permutations of climate variables are then simulated across all
available decades, with variable group values treated as discrete inputs. Additionally, to
incorporate variance due to the distinct parameterisations of the StrathE2E model for
CNRM-CM6-1-HR and GFDL-ESM4 forcing data, these permutations are completed separately with
different base parameterisations.

The total number of permutations can be calculated as:
$2ESMs ^{6variables} * 6decades * 2SSPs * 2parameterisations = 1,536permutations$.

### Climate change impacts permutation analyses

To understand how environmental drivers contribute to future change in model outputs across
decades, we perform variable permutations across three decades (2010-2019, 2030-2039 and
2060-2069) within each available climate scenario. Three of the six available decades are
used due to computational constraints. Within each climate scenario seven variable groups
(light, temperature, river outputs, vertical mixing, volume nutrient concentrations and
atmospheric nutrient flux) vary across decades, with three possible sets of values per
climate scenario (ESM-SSP combination). To streamline communication of guild Shapley Effect
results, we select guilds that have a PCA loading angle to the across decade variation
vector of less than 30° (in addition to assessment of Net Primary Production).

To assess the influence of these variable groups across climate change derived model
variation, within each climate scenario all unique combinations of variable group sets are
used as model inputs. These unique permutations of climate variables are supplied to the
model as inputs across the four available climate scenarios separately.

The total number of permutations run can be calculated as:
$3decades ^{7variables} * 4scenarios = 8,248permutations$.

We then use these permutations to assess the contribution of each variable group to the
variation in model results across the decades. Additionally, we use these permutations to
identify model runs where variable combinations of variable groups are changed to 2060-2069,
while other variables remain at a 2010-2019 baseline. These permutations are then used to
assess the influence of variable group interactions and the prevalence of non-linear
interactions.

## Further analyses

# Results

## Future climate impacts

The StrathE2E models for the Southern Benguela experience high parameter uncertainty,
resulting in large biomass confidence intervals for all guilds (@fig-biomass-timeseries). As
a result, this investigation does not assess predicted future biomass levels. Despite large
timeseries confidence intervals, these confidence bands remain largely uniform under climate
change (excluding demersal fish, demersal fish larvae and pinnipeds)
(@fig-biomass-timeseries), highlighting the consistent effects of climate change across
investigated parameter sets. This is most evident for Omnivorous zooplankton, and total
nitrogen mass, experiencing diverging trajectories across ESMs despite large confidence
intervals.

Demersal fish, demersal fish larvae and pinnipeds are particularly sensitive to changes in
model parameters (@fig-biomass-timeseries), experiencing broader confidence intervals than
lower trophic level guilds (@sfig-percent-biomass-timeseries). Guild production rates for
demersal fish show that modelled demersal fish gain greater nitrogen mass from recruitment
than from consumption, with recruitment sustaining net production at a positive level
(@stbl-dfish-biology). A local sensitivity analysis on demersal fish larvae physiological
parameters revealed that planktivorous fish, demersal fish, pinnipeds, birds and cetaceans
are highly sensitive to demersal fish larvae maximum nitrate uptake rate and nitrogen uptake
half-saturation coefficient values.

## Drivers of temporal ecosystem change

For guilds strongly correlated with temporal ecosystem change, Shapley Effect environmental
variable contribution values indicate that temperature, boundary flow and vertical mixing
driving variables contribute to 100% of the variance in modelled biomass levels. Light,
river outputs, nutrient concentrations and atmospheric nutrient flux driving variables do
not contribute to variance in modelled biomasses (@fig-across-decade-shap). When forced by
CNRM-CM6-1-HR, under SSP1-2.6 five of the six guilds are primarily driven by boundary flows,
followed by temperature and vertical mixing. Under SSP3-7.0 the contribution of temperature
to biomass variance increases. When forced by GFDL-ESM4, three of the six guilds are
primarily driven by boundary flows and three are primarily driven by vertical mixing, with
all guilds having low importance of temperature. Under all ESMs and SSPs deep layer
phytoplankton have distinct Shapley Effect values to other guilds. Interactions between
environmental variable groups account largely do not influence guild biomass outcomes, with
most variable interactions acting in a purely additively (variable 1 effect + variable 2
effect) (@sfig-var-interaction-hist).

![Shapley Effect contribution values for guilds identified as being strongly correlated with

contribution from light, river outputs, nutrient concentrations and atmospheric nutrient
flux variable
groups).](../figs/across_decade_permutations/important_guild_shapley.png){#fig-across-decade-shap
width="14.82cm"}

## Drivers of Earth System Model deviation

For guilds strongly correlated with ecosystem state separation across the Earth System
Models, Shapley Effect contribution values indicate high contribution from vertical mixing
(@fig-across-esm-shap). Boundary flows have the second highest contribution to across – ESM
variance. Variable groups such as nutrient concentrations, river outputs, light and
temperature have low contributions to across – ESM variance. Variable group contributions
for each guild show low sensitivity to StrathE2E model parameterisation, when compared
across the parameteristations for CNRM-CM6-1-HR baseline and GFDL-ESM4 baseline
(@fig-across-esm-shap).

# Discussion

-   **High level summary of results:**

Modelling the Southern Bengeula ecosystem using StrathE2E models highlights a strong
possible influence of climate change on the system, particularly for net primary
productivity and total nitrogen mass. Despite high levels of parameter uncertainty under
present and future conditions, future changes in temperature and water movement within and
in/out of the system may strongly effect ecosystem functioning.

<!-- The results of this investigation suggest the Southern Benguela ecosystem is projected to
change substantially from a 2010-2019 baseline. While benthos, phytoplankton and
planktivorous fish guilds are projected to decline, declines are not projected to cause
trophic cascades to top predators such as cetaceans, birds and demersal fish. Climate driven
ecosystem changes are projected to be primarily influenced by changes in temperature, flows
of nutrients into the region, and downwelling and upwelling between the deep and shallow
layers of the ecosystem. There have been few investigations into ecosystem impacts already
experienced due to climate change, however spatial distribution changes in West Coast Rock
Lobster *Jasus lalandii* in the region are correlated with changes in upwelling
[@blamey2012]. A surface level comparison of StrathE2E results suggests Carnivorous/Scavenge
feeding benthos may decline under climate change in the modelled region.

**For Kelly: Would you be able to expand on the consequences of the possible result
trajectories for the ecosystem?** -->

**Guilds with strong decadal trends and low ESM differences:**

High trophic level guilds in the southern Benguela model show high levels of variation due
to model parameter uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulations reveal particular uncertainty in
current and future estimates for Demersal Fish. In the southern Benguela implementation
adult Demersal fish are reliant on high recruitment of larvae into the guild to maintain
biomass. Top-predator guilds such as pinnipeds and seabirds are also sensitive to parameter
values influencing demersal fish larvae due to demersal fish contributing to substantial
proportions of their diets. Conclusions about demersal fish and top-predator guilds using
these StrathE2E implementations must consider that demersal fish event timing parameters
reflect available literature for Cape Hake species (*Merluccius capensis* and *Merluccius
paradoxus*).

It has been suggested that Cape Hake in the northern Benguela region (Namibia) experience
high annual variability in stock biomass [@macpherson1991] and recruitment [@kainge2013].
This investigation suggests that projections for demersal fish, and top predators, under
climate change are highly uncertain due to their sensitivity to demersal fish larval
parameters.

Under climate change predatory guilds are predicted to change in consistent ways across
ESMs, with many predatory guilds showing substantial increases in biomass relative to
2010-2019 levels. These guilds show low levels of trajectory divergence across the ESMs,
however the driving variables influencing biomass are distinct. Environmental forcing data
modelled using CNRM-CM6-1-HR shows substantially greater change in temperature over future
decades compared to GFDL-ESM4 (@sfig-driver-temp), aligning with the increased sensitivity
of CNRM-CM6-1-HR to increases in CO~2~ compared to GFDL-ESM4 **citation**. Additionally,
CNRM driving data shows substantially different seasonal trends in boundary flows compared
to GFDL-ESM4 with distinct patterns of nutrient inflows and outflows in the inshore region
(@sfig-driver-boundary-flows). GFDL-ESM4 forcing data shows greater a greater degree of
seasonal minimum and maximum levels of vertical diffusivity and offshore upwelling and
downwelling (@sfig-driver-vertical-mixing). While the low importance of nutrient
concentration variables

Although these predatory guilds, that experience substantial change in biomass, are
influenced by different climate change mechanisms when forced by different ESMs, their
biomass timeseries outcomes are similar across the ESMs. This indicates a greater level of
certainty in projected timeseries and biomass trends compared to other guilds that show high
levels of divergence and uncertainty across the ESMs chosen. Modelling for the Southern
Benguela region using an Atlantis ecosystem model projected declines for almost all
functional groups including top predators such as Cetaceans, seabirds and demersal fish such
as sharks [@ortega-cisneros2018]. Additionally, temperature was suggested as the most
influential driver of climate impacts on guilds, with water mixing having minor indirect
effects [@ortega-cisneros2018]. Differing magnitudes, directions and mechanisms of climate
change impacts on the ecosystem when modelled using Atlantis and StrathE2E frameworks
suggests there may be a high influence of structural (model) uncertainty for the Southern
Benguela.

Structural uncertainty arises due to choices made in the construction and implementation of
different ecosystem models such as the resolution of components (spatial, temporal,
taxonomic) and relationships/links that are represented [@payne2016]. @eddy2025 conducted a
large scale comparison of global (12 ecosystem models) and regional (Atlantis and Ecopath
with Ecosim) projections of biomass under climate change, including for the Southern
Benguela region. This comparison revealed high divergences in biomass projections in the
Southern Benguela region depending on the spatial scale of modelling and the ecosystem model
used [@eddy2025]. An in-depth comparison of modelling for the Southern Benguela ecosystem
using Atlantis, Ecopath with Ecosim, and StrathE2E would improve understanding about the
possible magnitude and drivers of climate change impacts, enhancing informed decision making
processes [@hill2007].

- **High scenario uncertainty (structural uncertainty in Earth System Modelling) and
    associated driving variables:**

The choice of the two Earth System Models for forcing StrathE2E strongly influences
projected ecosystem outcomes (@fig-biomass-pca). Low trophic level model components, as well
as Net Primary Production, display diverging trajectories under each ESM. Vertical mixing
contributes the most (\> 60%) to variance for the majority of these ecosystem components.
Vertical mixing variables (downwelling and upwelling rates, and vertical diffusivity) show
similar patterns under GFDL-ESM4 and CNRM-CM6-1-HR, with GFDL-ESM4 projecting greater
extremes and variance in vertical mixing. The high influence of vertical mixing on these
guilds despite lower future variance across ESMs than variable groups such as temperature
highlights the sensitivity of the lower trophic levels in the ecosystem to vertical mixing
changes.

The Southern Bengeula is known to experience high variability on multiple spatial and
temporal scales as a result of the high influence of upwelling [@lamont2014; @shannon2020].
Additionally, there is little consensus on how this ecosystem, and other EBUS globally, may
change in the future due to high levels of uncertainty around future upwelling changes
[@bograd2023; @garcía-reyes2015; @fox-kemper2021]. In a global comparison of EBUS NPP
projections using 13 ESMs @cioffi2025 found that differences in projected changes of
upwelling-favourable winds resulted in substantial model uncertainty in NPP. These
conclusions are supported by the results of this investigation, which suggest a high level
of uncertainty in ecosystem state projections is due to differences in vertical mixing
projections across Earth System Models. Expanding the range of Earth System Models used to
force StrathE2E in the region would improve estimates of model and scenario uncertainty.

**For Yuri: Would you be able to expand on the representation of upwelling in the Earth
System Models and NEMO-ERSEM?**

-   **Implications for monitoring and research under climate change:**

In the face of high uncertainty and diverging possible trajectories for the ecosystem,
climate change impact investigations would benefit from comparisons of a broad range of
ecosystem models, model parameterisations and environmental forcing scenarios. Approaches
such as Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty involve exploring a wide range of possible
ecosystem futures, helping to identify trajectories of environmental conditions, ecosystem
responses or management decisions that may lead to critical outcomes [@kalra2014]. The
results of this investigation have identified a strong influence of upwelling intensity
changes (minimum and maxmimum levels) under GFDL-ESM4. Exploring a broader range of futures
could help to identify critical patterns of upwelling that may lead to poor ecosystem
states, allowing the focussing of monitoring and trend assessment efforts.

**For Kelly: Would you be able to expand on any monitoring or modelling efforts that are
focussed on upwelling?**

-   **Highlighting why prediction is not the :**

Due to high parameter uncertainty evident in modelled guild outputs, this investigation does
not focus on specific predictions of guild biomass under climate change. Overall, modelled
trends have large confidence intervals for the biomass levels of all guilds. High
uncertainty arising from parameter estimates may be due to biased or inconsistent target
data used for fitting [@hilborn1992]. While parameterised using data spanning 2010-2019
where possible, target data for guild production rates and P:B ratios were sourced from
ecological models of the 1970-2015 that used departmental survey data to model fisheries
[@shannon2020]. Due to limited data availability, this investigation used reconstructed
fisheries data for the 2010-2019 period from Sea Around Us [@zeller2017] with domestic fleet
uncertainty scores ranging from "low" ($+/-$ 30%) to "very low" ($+/-$ 50%). Despite high
uncertainty scores, reconstructed catch timeseries for Sardines, Anchovies, Herring and Cape
Hakes closely match those reported in @statuso2023. For more information on the model
fitting process see **\\\[Insert Supplementary file link for implementation doc.\\\]**.
Despite poor quality and completeness of fitting target data, we use the StrathE2E models
outlined in this investigation to identify possible drivers of climate change impacts in the
Southern Benguela ecosystem.

## Limitations and future opportunities

-   **Low ESM sample size, could be expanded in future studies.**

## Model parameterisation and calibration

Model input data such as biological event timing and fisheries data were sourced from
regional and published sources **link to source table**. StrathE2E biological parameters
were calibrated using regional target observation data **link to target data source table**.
Calibration was performed using an iterative simulated annealing process where ecological
parameters **link to calibrated parameters table** are varied to increase the likelihood of
the ecological target data from simulated model results, then fishing harvest ratio
parameters are varied to calibrate the fishing model component. Once a suitable model fit is
reached the ecological and fishing parameters are calibrated together to the ecological and
fisheries landing target data. This fitting process was performed for a 2010-2015 CNRM
SSP3-7.0 baseline model. Additional information on model fitting can be found in **link to
implementation doc**.
