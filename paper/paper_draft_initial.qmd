## Initial climate change analyses

To assess how future change may impact the Southern Benguela ecosystem we model the
ecosystem using driving data across six decades (2010-19, 2020-29, 2030-39, 2040-49,
2050-59, 2060-69) under two ESMs (CNRM and GFDL **clarify the specific ESMs**) and two
Shared-Socioeconomic-Pathways (SSPs: SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0). Under these scenarios we
explore the steady state biomass values, averaged across the domain area, for each modelled
guild. To initially assess the broad climate change impacts we visualise these outputs as
timeseries across the decades.

To explore the drivers and trends of ecosystem state under climate change we perform
principal component analysis (PCA) on the steady state biomass values, transforming the data
to two dimensions (PC1 and PC2). We can then perform in depth analyses of the environmental
driving data and their variable influence on the ecosystem under climate change.

## Climate permutation analyses

To explore the influence of environemntal input driving data on the ecosystem under
different contexts we perform permutation analyses to calculate the overall contribution of
each variable group to the ecosystem outcomes. To perform these analyses we group the
variables according to @tbl-variable-groups. Once a set of permuted models is created we
then collate annual biomass results for each target guild and calculate the Shapley value of
each variable for each of the target guild biomass result sets.

variables are constant across variants of the South African StrathE2E2 model. \* Volume
nutrient concentration variable group includes separate variables for each water volume (so,
si, d). {#tbl-variable-groups}

### Climate modelling scenario permutation analyses

To assess how our environmental drivers contribute to overall model results across the
future climate scenarios (ESMs and SSPs), we perform permutations of variable values across
possible climate scenarios within each decade analysed. Within each decade six variable
groups (light, temperature, river outputs, vertical mixing and volume nutrient
concentrations) vary across ESMs and SSPs, with four possible sets of values per decade
(CNRM-SSP1-2.6, CNRM-SSP3-7.0, GFDL-SSP1-2.6, GFDL-SSP3-7.0). The atmospheric nutrient flux
variable group varies across SSP only, with only two possible sets of values per decade.

To assess the influence of these variable groups across climate scenario derived model
variation, within each decade all unique combinations of variable group sets are used as
model inputs (@fig-initial-analysis-diagram). These unique permutations of climate variables
are then modelled across the 3 chosen decades. We then use these permutations to assess the
contribution of each variable group to the variation in model results across the the climate
change modelling scenarios.

The total number of permutations run can be calculated as:

4scenarios \^ 6variables \* 2scenarios \^ 1variable \* 3decades = 24,576 model permutations

### Climate change impacts permutation analyses

To understand how environmental drivers contribute to the model outputs under climate change
(across decades), we perform variable permutations across decades within each available
climate scenario set. There are four sets of unique climate scenarios (CNRM-SSP1-2.6,
CNRM-SSP3-7.0, GFDL-SSP1-2.6, GFDL-SSP3-7.0). Within each climate scenario seven variable
groups (light, temperature, river outputs, vertical mixing, volume nutrient concentrations
and atmospheric nutrient flux) vary across decades, with three possible sets of values per
climate scenario (2010-2019, 2030-2039, 2060-2069). For example, under CNRM-SSP1-2.6 climate
scenario the temperature variable group has three unique value sets (one for each decade).

To assess the influence of these variable groups across climate change derived model
variation, within each climate scenario all unique combinations of variable group sets are
used as model inputs (\@fig-initial-analysis-diagram). These unique permutations of climate
variables are then supplied to the model as inputs across the four available climate
scenarios separately.

The total number of permutations run can be calculated as:

3decades \^ 7variables \* 4 scenarios = 8,248 model permutations

We then use these permutations to assess the contribution of each variable group to the
variation in model results across the decades. To identify groups of guilds (or
sub-networks) in the Southern Benguela ecosystem that may be influenced by similar sets of
variables we cluster the guilds based on their variable contribution values using a k-means
clustering algorithm.

### Variable swap analyses

Decade-swap permutations that have either a single variable group swapped to an alternative
decade, or all-but a single variable group swapped to an alternative decade are assessed.
Permutations with a single variable group substituted for an alternative decade are used to
investigate whether the selected variable group change is sufficient to drive climate change
impacts. Permutations with all-but a single variable group substituted are used to
investigate whether the constant variable group is necessary for driving climate change
impacts.

## Shapley effects

To calculate the importance of the variable groups for influencing the model outputs across
climate model scenarios and climate change futures, we perform Shapley effects analysis on
each set of inputs and results.
