# Introduction

# Methods

## Study Area

This investigation models the Southern Benguela ecosystem, extending from the northern South
Africa EEZ border to **x** place to meet the Aghulas current. To define the continental
shelf region included in this investigation, we exclude any areas that are situated at more
than 800m depth. We define the inshore region of the domain as continental shelf with a
depth of less than 50m and a distance to shore of 20km. This inshore region is defined to
separate the influence of nearshore processes such as river inputs and shore-based /
nearshore fishing pressure from the offshore region. The offshore region encapsulates all
other areas in the model domain beyond this boundary. The model domain is separated into 8
sediment-derived habitat types: rock, gravel, sand and mud sediment types for the inshore
and offshore zones. Sediment maps were digitised and georeferenced from Birch et al.
[-@birch1987]. These sediment types represent different levels of nutrient reflectance back
into the water column after settlement. The 8 habitat types are primarily used to
parameterise the distribution of fishing fleet pressure over the model domain area, rather
than explicitly represent the spatial distribution of the functional groups' biomass over
the habitats.

## Ecosystem model

We implement the StrathE2E end-to-end ecosystem model for the Southern Benguela region to
explore changes in ecosystem processes under future scenarios. StrathE2E models the flow of
nitrogen through the ecosystem using box models represented by couplped ordinary
differential equations. Nitrogen flow is tracked through a range of ecosystem components
from non-exploitable components such as disolved nitrogen, detritus and phytoplankton, to
exploitable guilds such as planktivorous fish, birds and seals. The models represent three
water volumes, inshore, shallow offshore and deep offshore. Representing the horizontal and
vertical flows of nutrients between these volumes, as well as external input of nutrients
from adjacent water masses and river inputs. Additional detail about the structure of
StrathE2E can be found in Heath et al. [-@heath2021].

### Parameterisation for Southern Benguela

To implement StrathE2E for the Southern Benguela, we collated region-specific inputs from
available data, literature and regional expert knowledge. This includes input data
representing fishing fleets operating in the region and their catch of the modelled guilds,
biological event timing data for key regional species for each guild and observational
target data for parameter optimisation of the ecosystem model. Additionally, environmental
driving data for the model implementation region was extracted from NemoERSEM output
\*\*insert NEMO-ERSEM citation\*\* (See environmental driving data section below).

| Source | Model Inputs | Time Period |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Sea Around Us - fishing catch data | Catch data separated into catch power (catch/activity) and discard rates | Parameterised with 2010-2019 data |
| South Africa National Biodiversity Institute - spatial fishing pressure data | Spatial distribution of fishing fleet activity | 2018 - layers finalised 2025 |
| Regional expert collaboration - target data | Fitting target data | 1978-2015 |
| World Ocean Atlas 2023 - monthly nitrate concentration data | Fitting target data | 2023 |
| Literature | Fishing fleet annual effort estimates, biological event timings | Parameterised using 2010-2019 literature, or nearest available time period values. Additional details can be found in **\[Insert link to implementation doc.\]** |

and the model inputs that each data source contributed to. Full information for the
implementation process and processing and use of each data source can be found at **\[Insert
implementation doc link.\]**. {#tbl-data-sources}

### Environmental driving data

StrathE2E uses monthly driving data for physical and chemical variables annually averaged
from each decadal time period. Physical driving data include variables such as temperature,
light, river inflow volumes and boundary flow rates for each water volume. Chemical driving
data include nutrient concentrations for each of the volumes and from sources such as water
volume boundaries and river inputs. Environmental driving data were extracted from
Nemo-ERSEM biogeochemical model outputs forced by two Earth System Models (ESMs: CNRM and
GFDL \[**clarify the specific ESM identifiers\]**) under two Shared-Socioeconomic-Pathways
(SSPs: SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0). Environmental driving data were averaged across decades
including 2010-2019, 2020-2029, 2030-2039, 2040-2049, 2050-2059, 2060-2069. Additional
information on environmental driving data processing can be found in \[**insert
supplementary table ref\]**.

## Initial climate change analyses

To assess how future change may impact the Southern Benguela ecosystem we model the
ecosystem using driving data across the six decades, under the two ESMs and two SSPs. Under
these scenarios we explore steady state biomass values, averaged across the domain area, for
each modelled guild. To assess the broad climate change impacts across these decades and
scenarios, we visualise these outputs as time series across the decades.

To explore the drivers and trends of ecosystem state under climate change we perform
principal component analysis (PCA) on the steady state biomass values, rotating the
multivariate guild biomass values along two principal components (PC1 and PC2).

## Climate permutation analyses

To quantify the influence of environmental input driving data on the state of the ecosystem
under different contexts we perform permutation analyses to calculate the contribution of
each variable group to the ecosystem outcomes. To perform these analyses we group variables
according to @tbl-variable-groups. Once a set of permuted models is created, we collate
annual biomass results for each target guild and calculate the variance-based Shapley Effect
value of each variable for each of the target guild biomass result sets.

| Variables | Variable group | Group description | Group varies across |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| sslight | Light | Surface light penetration. | Decade, ESM, SSP |
| so_temp, d_temp, si_temp | Temperature | Water volume temperatures. | Decade, ESM, SSP |
| rivervol, rivnitrate, rivammonia, rivdetritus | River outputs | River output volume and nutrient outflow concentrations into si habitat. | Decade, ESM, SSP |
| logkvert, d_so_upwelling, so_d_downwelling | Vertical mixing | Upwelling and downwelling between surface and deep offshore water volumes. | Decade, ESM, SSP |
| domain inflow variables, so_si_flow | Horizontal flows | Inflow rates of water into si, so and d water volumes. Movement of water from surface offshore to inshore volumes. | Decade, ESM, SSP |
| \*\_nitrate, \*\_ammonia, \*\_phyt, \*\_detritus | Volume nutrient concentrations | Nutrient concentrations for each water volume (so, si and d). | Decade, ESM, SSP |
| so_atmnitrate, so_atmammonia, si_atmnitrate, si_atmammonia | Atmospheric nutrient flux | Deposition rates of nitrate and ammonia into surface water volumes. | Decade, SSP |

groups allocated to variables, and levels they vary across. All other chemistry and physics
driving variables are constant across variants of the Southern Benguela StrathE2E2 model.

### Shapley effects

Shapley Effects quantify the contribution of a variable to variance in a target model
output. Variance-based Shapley Effects are an extension of Shapley Values, which are a fair
way to calculate the contribution of each variable to a given output [@shapley1952]
(@eq-shapleyvalue).

$$
\phi_j(val) = \sum_{S \subseteq \{1,\ldots,p\}\setminus\{j\}} 
   \frac{|S|!(p-|S|-1)!}{p!}\,\big(val(S \cup \{j\}) - val(S)\big)
$$ {#eq-shapleyvalue}

Where $\phi_j$ is the Shapley value for variable $j$, $S$ is a subset of input variables not
including $j$. To extend this calculation to variance-based Shapley Effects [@song2016] on
discrete inputs (levels = model variants), we substitute $val(S)$ for @eq-varexplained,
calculating the output variance explained by a inputs from a set of variables $S$. The
resulting Shapley Effect for variable $j$ represents the sum of marginal contributions of
variable $j$ to all coalitions of other input variables. By calculating the contribution of
$j$ to all possible coalitions of other variables, Shapley Effects incorporate the
interactions between variables, using a full factorial permutation set to calculate exact
Shapley Effects.

### Climate modelling scenario permutation analyses

To assess how our environmental drivers contribute to model outputs across the future
climate scenarios (ESMs and SSPs), we perform permutations of variables across possible
climate scenarios, within each decade analysed. Within each decade, six variable groups
(light, temperature, river outputs, vertical mixing and volume nutrient concentrations) vary
across ESMs and SSPs, with four possible sets of values per decade (CNRM-SSP1-2.6,
CNRM-SSP3-7.0, GFDL-SSP1-2.6, GFDL-SSP3-7.0). The atmospheric nutrient flux variable group
varies across SSP only, with only two possible sets of values per decade.

To assess the influence of these variable groups across climate scenario derived model
variation, within each decade the full factorial cross of variable group sets are used as
model inputs (@fig-initial-analysis-diagram). These unique permutations of climate variables
are then modelled across the 3 chosen decades, with variable group values treated as
discrete inputs (model variants).

The total number of permutations can be calculated as:
$(4scenarios ^{6variables} * 2scenarios ^{1variable}) * 3decades = 24,576permutations$.

### Climate change impacts permutation analyses

To understand how environmental drivers contribute to future change in model outputs across
decades, we perform variable permutations across three decades (2010-2019, 2030-2039 and
2060-2069) within each available climate scenario. Within each climate scenario seven
variable groups (light, temperature, river outputs, vertical mixing, volume nutrient
concentrations and atmospheric nutrient flux) vary across decades, with three possible sets
of values per climate scenario (ESM-SSP combination).

To assess the influence of these variable groups across climate change derived model
variation, within each climate scenario all unique combinations of variable group sets are
used as model inputs (@fig-initial-analysis-diagram). These unique permutations of climate
variables are supplied to the model as inputs across the four available climate scenarios
separately.

The total number of permutations run can be calculated as:
$(3decades ^{7variables}) * 4scenarios = 8,248permutations$.

We then use these permutations to assess the contribution of each variable group to the
variation in model results across the decades. To identify groups of guilds (ecosystem
sub-networks) in the Southern Benguela ecosystem that are influenced by similar sets of
variables we cluster the guilds based on their variable contribution values using a k-means
clustering algorithm.

#### Variable swap analyses

Decade-swap permutations that have either a single variable group swapped to an alternative
decade, or all-but a single variable group swapped to an alternative decade are assessed.
Permutations with a single variable group substituted for an alternative decade are used to
investigate whether the selected variable group change is sufficient to drive climate change
impacts. Permutations with all-but a single variable group substituted are used to
investigate whether the constant variable group is necessary for driving climate change
impacts.

## Model parameterisation and calibration

Model input data such as biological event timing and fisheries data were sourced from
regional and published sources **link to source table**. StrathE2E biological parameters
were calibrated using regional target observation data **link to target data source table**.
Calibration was performed using an iterative simulated annealing process where ecological
parameters **link to calibrated parameters table** are varied to increase the likelihood of
the ecological target data from simulated model results, then fishing harvest ratio
parameters are varied to calibrate the fishing model component. Once a suitable model fit is
reached the ecological and fishing parameters are calibrated together to the ecological and
fisheries landing target data. This fitting process was performed for a 2010-2015 CNRM
SSP3-7.0 baseline model. Additional information on model fitting can be found in **link to
implementation doc**.
